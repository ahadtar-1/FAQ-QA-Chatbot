Q1. What is new in Windows Server 2012?
Windows Server 2012 brings our company's experience building and operating public clouds to the server platform for private clouds. The new licensing and packaging makes it easier to manage workloads in highly virtualized public and private cloud environments. Windows Server 2012 will move to a consistent licensing model and will have common features enabling the reduction of editions. These include
· Two editions, Standard and Datacenter. · Single licenses that cover up to two physical processors. · Editions differentiated by virtualization rights only (two for Standard; unlimited for Datacenter).

Q2. What is the difference between Windows Server 2012 Standard edition and Windows Server 2012 Datacenter edition?
Both Standard and Datacenter editions provide the same set of features; the only thing that differentiates the editions is the number of Virtual Machines (VMs). A Standard edition license will entitle you to run up to two VMs on up to two processors (subject to the VM use rights outlined in the Product Use Rights document). A Datacenter edition license will entitle you to run an unlimited number of VMs on up to two processors.

Q4. Is Windows Server 2012 aligning to the System Center 2012 and Enrollment for Core Infrastructure (ECI) model?
Yes. As part of the alignment with the Microsoft private cloud licensing model, Windows Server 2012 and System Center 2012, as well as Enrollment for Core Infrastructure (ECI), will have the same licensing and packaging structure. These include
· Two editions, Standard and Datacenter. · Single licenses that cover up to two physical processors. · Editions differentiated by virtualization rights only (two for Standard; unlimited for Datacenter).
Client Access Licenses (CALs) will continue to be required for access to Windows Server 2012 servers.

Q6. How do I determine which Windows Server 2012 edition is right for me?
Since there is feature parity between Windows Server 2012 Standard and Datacenter editions, your decision will be based solely on your virtualization strategy as virtualization rights become the only differentiator between editions. If your strategy calls for a highly virtualized environment, Datacenter edition will provide you with optimum flexibility since it allows for unlimited virtualization. If you do not plan on a highly virtualized environment at this time, Standard edition is the right product for your needs. If you purchase Standard edition today but find that you need more capacity in the future you will have two options to expand the virtualization capacity of your licensed server:
1. Purchase additional Standard edition licenses and assign them to the same physical server giving you the rights to run additional instances of Windows Server, or 2. If you have Software Assurance on your Standard license you can purchase a Software Assurance Step-Up and migrate to a Datacenter edition license on that server
If you are running a highly virtualized environment, management may also be a need for you. You should consider purchasing System Center 2012 with Windows Server 2012 together in the Core Infrastructure Suite, which is available inside or outside of an Enrollment for Core Infrastructure (ECI) agreement.

Question Answer Pair Ended
Q7. If I have a Windows Server 2012 Standard edition license, how can I increase my virtualization rights?
With the Windows Server 2012 Standard edition licensing model, you can grow your virtualization environment by either stepping up your license to Datacenter edition if you have Software Assurance, or by simply buying additional Standard edition licenses and assigning them to the same physical server. For example, if you have a 2-processor server and want to run a total of 4 VMs, you can purchase two Standard edition licenses and assign them to the same server. Additional examples are shown in the table below.

A single server can host a varying number of virtual machines (VMs) depending on the number of Standard edition licenses it possesses. With one license, the server can support two VMs. Increasing the licenses to two allows for four VMs. If the server has three licenses, it can accommodate six VMs. Finally, with four licenses, the server can host a total of eight VMs. This relationship shows a direct proportionality between the number of licenses and the total number of VMs, with each additional license enabling two more VMs.

Q8. Why is Windows Server 2012 licensing moving to a processor model?
By making this change, Windows Server 2012, System Center 2012 and the Core Infrastructure Server (CIS) will all have consistent licensing model creating alignment across Microsoft infrastructure products. Having a single-licensing model will make it easier for you to buy the right product for your needs and to compare the cost of alternatives (such as individual products, the CIS SKU outside of ECI, ECI and SO on). Additionally, the new licensing model provides a single, familiar, and easy-to-track metric for all infrastructure products further reducing management overhead.

Question Answer Pair Ended
Q9. How do I calculate the number of licenses I need for a server?
The number of licenses you will need depends on the number of physical processors on the server and the number of server instances that you will be running. (This only applies for Standard edition because Datacenter edition allows for unlimited VMs.) The larger of these two numbers determines the number of total licenses required.
Determining the number of physical processor licenses
Each license covers up to two physical processors, SO to determine the number of licenses needed to fully license a physical server, simply count the number of physical processors in the server, divide that number by two and that tells you the number of licenses that will be needed.
Here are some examples:
· You have a 2-processor server. 2 physical processors / 2 (number of processors covered by a license) equals 1. You will need one license to cover a 2-processor server.
· You have a 4-processor server. 4 physical processors / 2 (number of processors covered by a license) equals 2. You will need two licenses to cover a 4-processor server.
· You have an 8-processor server. 8 physical processors / 2 (number of processors covered by a license) equals 4. You will need four licenses to cover an 8-processor server.
Determining the number of virtual instances running
If you want to run additional VMs but do not require the highly virtualized environment that Datacenter provides (which is unlimited VMs), then you can simply purchase additional Standard edition licenses and assign them to a single physical server to increase your VM entitlements on that server. Each Standard edition license provides you with the rights to run up to two VMs, so to determine the number of Windows Server Standard edition licenses you need, count the total number of total VMs that you will run on the server; divide that number by two, and round up to the nearest whole number.
For example, if you assign 2 Standard edition licenses to a single server, you will be able to run a total of 4 VMs on that server. If you add additional Standard edition licenses to that server the number of allowed VMs on that particular server will increase by two for a total of six VMs on that server.
Once the number of licenses needed to cover a physical processor and/or additional VMs is determined, the higher of those two numbers represents the total number of licenses required.
For example, if you are running 4 virtual machines on a 2-processor server, you will require 1 license to cover the 2 processors; but you will need an additional license to run 4 virtual machines, which means you will need a total of 2 licenses.

Q12. Can I assign a Windows Server 2012 license to a virtual machine?
No. A license is assigned to the physical server. Each license will cover up to two physical processors.

Q13. Can I mix Datacenter and Standard licenses on the same server?
No. All of the processors on a given server must be licensed with the same version and edition. You can run different editions or older versions of Windows Server software as guests within VMs, but you are not allowed to assign multiple licenses of different versions or editions to the same physical server to license the processors on the server.

Question Answer Pair Ended
Q14. Can I attach another license of a different version or edition of Windows Server to increase my virtualization rights?
Yes, you can assign additional Windows Server licenses to a server to increase your virtualization rights. However the newly assigned licenses will need to adhere to their associated licensing rules. For example, if you have a Windows Server Enterprise edition license on a four processor server and want to attach Windows Server 2012 Standard edition licenses to increase your virtualization rights, you will need to ensure that all processors on that server are licensed with Windows Server 2012 Standard edition license as well, which will require a total of two Windows Server 2012 Standard licenses (as each license covers up to two processors).

Question Answer Pair Ended
Q15. If I want to use the bits from an earlier version or edition, what are my options?
If you have Windows Server 2012 Datacenter edition you will have the right to downgrade your bits to any prior version or lower edition. If you have Windows Server 2012 Standard edition, you will have the right to downgrade your bits to any prior version of Enterprise, Standard or Essentials editions.
The ability to run downgrade bits does not change the licensing or support terms in which you can use the product; the purchased product (Windows Server 2012) rights apply. This means that the license will continue to cover two physical processors and the virtualization rights do not change. In addition, the Client Access License (CAL) corresponding to the purchased version will apply, as an exception, if you are running a previous version of one of the eligible downgrades you can use the corresponding CAL version if one exists.
Here are a few examples.

For those who have purchased a Datacenter 2012 license, the option to downgrade is available to Datacenter 2008. The applicable bit rights for this downgrade are also Datacenter 2008, while the licensing rights remain as Datacenter 2012. 

In the case of a Standard 2012 license, there are multiple downgrade options. One can downgrade to Enterprise 2008 R2, with the bit rights applicable to Enterprise 2008 R2, and the licensing rights reverting to Standard 2012. Alternatively, a downgrade to Standard 2008 is possible, with corresponding bit rights and licensing rights both aligning with Standard 2012. Another option is to downgrade to Essentials 2012, with the bit rights applicable to Essentials 2012, while the licensing rights are maintained as Standard 2012. 

These options provide flexibility in managing software versions while retaining specific licensing rights.
1 The license will cover up to two processors. 2 The license entitles up to two virtual machines.

Q16. Is Enterprise edition going away as part of Windows Server 2012 and why?
Yes. Enterprise edition will be retired as part of the Windows Server 2012 release. Windows Server 2012 Standard edition will include all the premium features previously included in Enterprise edition in the past and the price to purchase the rights to 4 instances of Windows Server 2012 will actually be less expensive than the price of Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise edition today. Due to these changes, we have been able to simplify the product lineup while reducing the price per instance of Windows Server for these customers.

Q18. Are the HPC products going away as part of Windows Server 2012 and why?
While the HPC edition is being retired, Microsoft will be delivering the HPC Pack 2012 as a free download that can be used with any Windows Server 2012 Standard or Datacenter license. As a result, customers who want to run HPC workloads will be able to do SO on any of their Windows Server 2012 licensed servers (Click here for a free download.). HPC workloads running on Windows Server 2012 Standard or Datacenter editions will continue to receive the "CAL waiver" that is currently in effect for these workloads. Windows Server CALs will not be required to access instances of Windows Server in the Windows Server 2012 licensing model if these instances are simply running HPC workloads.

Q26. What are my Software Assurance migration rights by Microsoft purchase program?
Each Microsoft purchase program has different rules for your Software Assurance migration entitlement at the end of your enrollment. See the chart below.

The Enterprise Agreement and Open Value programs provide perpetual rights to the Windows Server 2012 edition. This means users can continue using the software indefinitely after the agreement period ends. 

For the Enterprise Agreement Subscription, Enrollment for Education Solutions, Open Value Subscription, and Open Value Subscription for Education Solutions, users can utilize the Windows Server 2012 edition during their enrollment. At the end of the enrollment, there is an option to buy out the original Windows Server 2008 R2 product at the original CPS price or purchase the new Windows Server 2012 product at the buy-out price listed at the time. Alternatively, users can renew their enrollment at the new Windows Server 2012 annual subscription price. 

These options provide flexibility in maintaining access to the software, either through outright purchase or continued subscription.

Under the Select/Open program, participants are granted perpetual rights to the current edition of Windows Server 2012. This means that once the software is acquired, the user has the right to use it indefinitely without the need for further renewals or additional payments for that specific version. This arrangement provides long-term access and stability for users who choose this program, ensuring they can continue to utilize the Windows Server 2012 edition as needed.

Q34. What are my licensing options for a Disaster Recovery server?
If you are storing virtual machines for future use in a Disaster Recovery situation you will not need additional licensing for that server. Only when you run an instance on that server will a license be required (see the definition of running an instance below). You should be mindful that any of your replicated virtual instances, when running, need to be running on a server appropriately licensed to support that running instance.
Running Instance means an Instance of software that is loaded into memory and for which one or more instructions have been executed. (You "Run an Instance" of software by loading it into memory and executing one or more of its instructions.) Once running, an Instance is considered to be running (whether or not its instructions continue to execute) until it is removed from memory.
There are two ways in which you can license a server for Disaster Recovery, by purchasing a Windows Server license or by using the Cold Back-up for Disaster Recovery Software Assurance benefit. Cold Back-up for Disaster Recovery allows you to keep a backup server ready for use in case your primary (production) server fails due to earthquakes, floods or any kind of disaster. If a disaster strikes you can immediately switch over to the Cold Disaster Recovery server. In order to utilize this benefit you must comply with the follow terms:
· The software in the Disaster Recovery server should comply with the use rights associated with the software. · The server cannot be in the same cluster as the production server. · The server cannot be turned on except for updates to the software (patching) or testing. The server may of course be turned on in the event of a disaster for Disaster Recovery. · The Disaster Recovery server and the production instances may run concurrently while recovering from a disaster. At all other times the Disaster Recovery server should be switched off except as above
Remember that in order to utilize this Software Assurance benefit, all licenses in use must have active Software Assurance coverage. This includes any CALs required to access the Disaster Recovery server. This benefit ends when Software Assurance coverage on your licenses ends. You can find more information about the use rights for this benefit in the Product Use Rights document.
